      Dear Yowpii,<br><br>
Hii babyy! First of all, i want to thank you very much for your efforts—the libres, materials and stuff u gave mee and of course, yung time mo para lang makasama akoo. I really really appreciate it❤️❤️ and it makes me tear a littleHAHAHA.<br><br> yk, I was not looking for you when you met me, but now with you, it feels like a part of me always wanted to love you, my heart stopped searching for anything else the moment it found you, you became a part of me(so please take care of yourselfff, i cant afford to losee youu jwishehw im rlly worried na kung anong mangyari sayooo😓😓) na kahit kailanman di ko hahayaang mawala. I will assure youu, na hindiii akoo aaliss sa tabi moo, no matter what, tumigil man ang oras, umikot-ikot man ang mundo, maghiwalay man ang mga continents, o kahit sa katiting na pag galaw ng baso. I will make you feel loved, i will give an unconditional love that u deserve. I will assure you to that i will answer all your calls. Find me when your family hurts you, Ill be your family. Find me when your friends let you down, Ill be your friend. Find me when the world feels too heavy to carry alone, Ill carry it with you. When your heart feels like its breaking, when youre tired of being strong, when silence gets loud and no one seems to hear you, find me. Ill always be here no matter what. I wont promise to fix everything, But I promise you wont face it alone. Ill sit with you in the dark, Ill remind you of your light, your worth, And Ill try my best to bring back your smile, inch by inch, piece by piece. You could show me all the parts of you that you think are unloveable and id show you how it makes me love you more. Even when you think youre hard to love, ill remind you that youre not, becuz youre just a human, and thats exactly who i chose. Even if you doubt my love for you for a thousand times, i will remind you a thousand times that you are the only person I want in my life. I may not always know the right words to say or how to comfort you the way you need, but i want you to know that Ill always be here to listen(ALAM NA ALAM MO YANNN), to understand, to share whatever youre going throughhh, to support you in everything you do and watch you win in life. Ill be the greatest fan of your lifeeeee and i love youuu so muchh!!
